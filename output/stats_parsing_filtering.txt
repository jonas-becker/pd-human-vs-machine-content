FILTERING STATS 

Explanation:
first number: theoretical dataset size
after filtering: what we are using
duplicates: NOT text1 == text2, but rather text1=text1 OR text2=text2
filtered pairs: pairs that have either empty text fields like "", "\n", ... our where text1 == text2. Only counted up until the max 10k pairs per dataset were reached.
