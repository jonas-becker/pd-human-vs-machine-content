       "3  Football-themed stories were a staple of British funnies for young men from the 1950s onwards, and Roy of the Rovers was the most prevalent. To keep the strip energizing, Melchester was pretty much consistently either seeking real distinctions or battling against transfer to a lower division; a typical, uneventful period of mid-table unremarkableness was obscure at Melchester Rovers. The strip pursued the structure of the real English football season, along these lines there were a while every year in summer when there was no association football. By a long shot the most well-known summer storyline saw Melchester visiting an anecdotal nation in a fascinating piece of the world, regularly South America, where they would perpetually be grabbed and held to recover. The normal peruser presumably remained with the comic consistently for just three or four years, in this way storylines were now and then reused; amid the initial ten years of his playing vocation, Roy was seized something like multiple times. Roy likewise shown up for England, delineated playing nearby real players, for example, Malcolm Macdonald and Trevor Francis.   \n",

To keep the strip exciting, Melchester was almost every year either competing for major honours or struggling against relegation to a lower division; a normal, uneventful season of mid-table mediocrity was unknown at Melchester Rovers. The strip followed the structure of the actual English football season, thus there were several months each year in summer when there was no league football. By far the most common summer storyline saw Melchester touring a fictional country in an exotic part of the world, often South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. The average reader probably stayed with the comic regularly for only three or four years, therefore storylines were sometimes recycled; during the first ten years of his playing career, Roy was kidnapped at least four times. Roy also made numerous appearances for England, depicted playing alongside actual players such as Malcolm Macdonald and Trevor Francis.</td>\n",

The strip first appeared in the \"Tiger\" in 1954, before giving its name to a weekly (and later monthly) comic magazine, published by IPC and Fleetway from 1976 until 1995, in which it was the main feature.   \n",

When the monthly comic was launched later that year the focus switched to Roy's son Rocky, who also played for Melchester. This publication was short-lived, and folded after only 19 issues. The adventures of the Race family were subsequently featured in the monthly \"Match of the Day\" football magazine, in which father and son were reunited as manager and player respectively. These strips began in 1997 and continued until the magazine's closure in May 2001.   \n",
       "3     Football-themed stories were a staple of British comics for boys from the 1950s onwards, and Roy of the Rovers was the most popular. To keep the strip exciting, Melchester was almost every year either competing for major honours or struggling against relegation to a lower division; a normal, uneventful season of mid-table mediocrity was unknown at Melchester Rovers. The strip followed the structure of the actual English football season, thus there were several months each year in summer when there was no league football. By far the most common summer storyline saw Melchester touring a fictional country in an exotic part of the world, often South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. The average reader probably stayed with the comic regularly for only three or four years, therefore storylines were sometimes recycled; during the first ten years of his playing career, Roy was kidnapped at least four times. Roy also made numerous appearances for England, depicted playing alongside actual players such as Malcolm Macdonald and Trevor Francis.   \n",
