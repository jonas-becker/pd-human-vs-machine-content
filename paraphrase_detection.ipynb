       "3  Football-themed stories were a staple of British funnies for young men from the 1950s onwards, and Roy of the Rovers was the most prevalent. To keep the strip energizing, Melchester was pretty much consistently either seeking real distinctions or battling against transfer to a lower division; a typical, uneventful period of mid-table unremarkableness was obscure at Melchester Rovers. The strip pursued the structure of the real English football season, along these lines there were a while every year in summer when there was no association football. By a long shot the most well-known summer storyline saw Melchester visiting an anecdotal nation in a fascinating piece of the world, regularly South America, where they would perpetually be grabbed and held to recover. The normal peruser presumably remained with the comic consistently for just three or four years, in this way storylines were now and then reused; amid the initial ten years of his playing vocation, Roy was seized something like multiple times. Roy likewise shown up for England, delineated playing nearby real players, for example, Malcolm Macdonald and Trevor Francis.   \n",

By far the most common summer storyline saw Melchester touring a fictional country in an exotic part of the world, often South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. The average reader probably stayed with the comic regularly for only three or four years, therefore storylines were sometimes recycled; during the first ten years of his playing career, Roy was kidnapped at least four times.

When the monthly comic was launched later that year the focus switched to Roy's son Rocky, who also played for Melchester. This publication was short-lived, and folded after only 19 issues. The adventures of the Race family were subsequently featured in the monthly \"Match of the Day\" football magazine, in which father and son were reunited as manager and player respectively. These strips began in 1997 and continued until the magazine's closure in May 2001.   \n",
       "3  Football-themed stories were a staple of British comics for boys from the 1950s onwards, and Roy of the Rovers was the most popular. To keep the strip exciting, Melchester was almost every year either competing for major honours or struggling against relegation to a lower division; a normal, uneventful season of mid-table mediocrity was unknown at Melchester Rovers. The strip followed the structure of the actual English football season, thus there were several months each year in summer when there was no league football. By far the most common summer storyline saw Melchester touring a fictional country in an exotic part of the world, often South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. The average reader probably stayed with the comic regularly for only three or four years, therefore storylines were sometimes recycled; during the first ten years of his playing career, Roy was kidnapped at least four times. Roy also made numerous appearances for England, depicted playing alongside actual players such as Malcolm Macdonald and Trevor Francis.   \n",

After 22 years of continued popularity, the strip was judged successful enough to sustain its own weekly comic, the eponymous \"Roy of the Rovers\", launched on 25 September 1976. The comic ran for 851 issues, until 20 March 1993, and included other football strips and features. At the peak of the comic's success about 450,000 copies were sold each week. There were also hardback annuals and holiday specials featuring a mix of reprinted and original content, and for a brief period, starting in 1986, Roy of the Rovers was serialised in the now defunct \"Today\" newspaper. These were all-new strips, focusing largely on the relationship between Roy and his wife Penny, rather than the action on the pitch. Between 1988 and 1993, a \"Best of Roy of the Rovers\" monthly comic was published, reprinting older stories.   \n",

These strips kept running until the magazine's death in May 2001. By then the strip's healthy tone, regularly embracing the ideals of reasonable play and solid good character, was starting to appear to be antiquated. The manager of \"Roy of the Rovers\" comic, Barrie Tomlinson, has remarked that \"everybody appeared to grow up more rapidly, and they needed stories that were progressively practical\". This arrangement kept running until 2001.   \n",
